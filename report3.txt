Task 3.3
method in Dates: daysInMonth(), method argument: month

Variables in Main:
      daysBetween
      someMonth
      someDay
      laterMonth
      laterDay


Task 3.4  Finding the bug(s?)

line 37: for (; aMonth < laterMonth; aMonth = aMonth + 1)
aMonth is never declared which cause an bug in this for loop but the previous which means it starts on another
month rather then the intented month

line 11: if ((month == 9) || (month == 7) || (month == 6) || (month == 11)) {}
line 12: return 30;
This is a bug due to correct months having 30 days are 4, 6, 9 and 11

line 46: daysBetween = laterDayInYear - someDayInYear;
line 48: daysBetween = daysBetween + laterDay - someDay;
We recalculate daysBetween based on the input arguments again which is incorrect.

-Days in month return faltuie values and in addition to, the loop is just adding days

    test1. 1 1 1 1
    //Result equal -31

    test2. 1 1 2 1
    //result equal 0

    test3.  1 1 3 1
    //equal 31

    test4 1 1 -1000 2
    //equal -31
